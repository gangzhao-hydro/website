My name is Zhao Gang (赵刚). I am currently working as an Assistant Professor at the <a href="https://www.titech.ac.jp/english/about/organization/schools/organization06">School of Environment and Society at the Tokyo Institute of Technology</a>. I research with Prof. Tsuyoshi Kinouchi. You can visit our research group website here: <a href="http://fa.depe.titech.ac.jp/kinouchi/index-j.html">木内研究室</a>.

Research interests: Flood hazard and risk
======
<p style="text-align: justify;">
Flood hazards rank among the most destructive natural disasters, causing significant economic damage and impacting millions of lives annually. A recent example is the heavy flooding at Dongting Lake in Yueyang, Hunan Province, central China. See <a href="http://english.scio.gov.cn/in-depth/2024-07/09/content_117298698.htm">this detailed report</a> for more information. This event was triggered by floodwaters from torrential rains, leading to the evacuation of over 7,000 residents after the dike burst on Friday afternoon.
The need for accurate flood hazard maps has grown significantly due to increasing severe flood events. As shown in Figure 1, statistics of major natural disasters worldwide between 1970 and 2022 indicate that floods are the predominant natural hazard, with their frequency rising substantially. Currently, flood mitigation responsibilities have shifted from being solely a governmental task to a shared responsibility among communities, insurance companies, high-tech industries, and residents in flood-prone areas.

My research interests primarily focus on flood modeling, using physics-based models and state-of-the-art artificial intelligence (AI) techniques. I have worked with two top-tier flood research groups worldwide. My PhD research was completed at the University of Bristol under the supervision of <a href="https://www.bristol.ac.uk/people/person/Paul-Bates-9d424135-ad4d-485d-8607-648c8890b4fa/">Professor Paul Bates</a> and <a href="https://www.bristol.ac.uk/people/person/Jeffrey-Neal-f0be79ed-1273-476b-8a6f-11849893a4b4/">Professor Jeff Neal</a>, who are the developers of the LISFLOOD-FP hydrodynamic model. Afterward, I worked as a postdoctoral researcher at the global hydrodynamic group at the University of Tokyo with <a href="https://global-hydrodynamics.github.io/">Dr. Dai Yamazaki</a>, co-developing the CaMa-Flood global hydrodynamic model. Additionally, I have also collaborated with commercial companies such as FATHOM and GAIA Vision Inc. to produce commercial flood products.
